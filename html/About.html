      <p class="card-text">FundingEquality exists because not-for-profits, community groups, and individual activists, all around the work do not have enough employed staff, or time to spend in doing research, writing, and budgeting project proposals. Our mission is helping not-for-profits, community groups, and individual activists that work in the fields of environment and climate change, security and peacebuilding, gender equality and youth empowerment, with research, writing project concept-notes, writing full narrative project proposals, budgeting project proposals, and accessing a database of funding opportunities. We want to provide the same opportunities for accessing funding and grants to not-for-profits, community groups, and individual activists - origin, background, size, gender, race, identity, religion, ethnicity, location, region, area of operation, age or year of establishment. As long as they have an idea that if implemented will have a positive impact in their community, we are there to help you make it happen. Our staff is comprised by academia and experts working in the fields of environment and climate change, security and peacebuilding, gender equality and youth empowerment, with international experience of up to 26 years.</p>
